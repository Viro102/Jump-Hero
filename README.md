## My first 2D game in Java

This is my university project, I am a total beginner. So don't expect Mario level platforming experience.
But it was a great learning experience. It took a lot of sweat and tears.
Some code is copied from the net but I modified it. So it wasn't just copy and paste.
I tried to understand the code which i copied.

## You can play the game if you head to releases, there is a download for the .jar file

More info is in the doc dir, hope you enjoyed and till next time, bye! :).
